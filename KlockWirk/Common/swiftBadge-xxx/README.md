# Overview

This is a badge view for iOS 7+ written in Swift. The style is similar to the springboard badges in iOS 7 or 8.
The view is a subclass of UILabel view.

## Usage

Copy [SwiftBadge.swift](https://github.com/marketplacer/swift-badge/blob/master/swift-badge/SwiftBadge.swift) to your project. A badge can be created and positioned similar to any UIView.

Swift badge is written in Swift 2.0 for Xcode 7. To use it with Swift 1.2 get the [SwiftBadge.swift for Xcode 6](https://github.com/marketplacer/swift-badge/blob/swift-1.2/swift-badge/SwiftBadge.swift) or checkout the `swift-1.2` tag.




### Creating a badge in storyboard

* Drag a **Label** to your view.
* Set its `class` to `SwiftBadge` in identity inspector.

* Add auto layout constraints to position the badge.
* Font can be set in the attribute inspector.
* Colors and shadow can only be customized in code (see below).

Note:

* Badge will still look like an ordinary label in storyboard.
* There is no need to set size or width/height constraints for the badge in the storyboard. The size will be determined dynamically based on badge text. You can see how it is done in this demo app.

### Creating a badge from code

```
let badge = SwiftBadge()
view.addSubview(badge)
```

## Customization

```
// text
badge.text = '2'

// insets
badge.defaultInsets = CGSize(width: 12, height: 12)

// font
badge.font = UIFont.preferredFontForTextStyle(UIFontTextStyleBody)

// text color
badge.textColor = UIColor.yellowColor()

// background color
badge.layer.backgroundColor = UIColor.blackColor().CGColor

// shadow
badge.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.5
badge.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 0, height: 0)
badge.layer.shadowRadius = 1.0
badge.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.blackColor().CGColor

// no shadow
badge.layer.shadowOpacity = 0
```

Tip: try calling `badge.invalidateIntrinsicContentSize()` if propery changes are not updated.

## Alternative

There is a great alternative badge created by Sascha Paulus in Objective-C.
